There seems to be an inordinate amount of the seeds that come out a weird beige color, but it still tastes great and is a much better deal than any of the Indian markets in town. Cheers to Frontier."

All you do is put 1/2 cup of oats in a little crockpot with 2 cups of boiling water before you go to bed, then an hour before I get up the crockpot starts on high on a timer so when I get out of the shower the oatmeal is ready to go.  Just mix in some blueberries, raisins, craisins, dates, nuts or whatever you want and eat."

I have bought the Numi Loose Leaf ones which is cheaper, but it's not worth the saving. Buy this one and you will have quality, aromatic tea."

I had to pick some up for the office, and the price was right. I was very pleasantly surprised with the coffee! Better flavor than some K-Cups that cost a lot more."

This product is good but does not taste like the other jalapeno chips on the market (Lays, Ms.Vickie). I am now used to this flavor and eat it as it is healthy but wish it had that addicting jalapeno flavor that the other ones on the market have."

People are always commenting that she doesn't have bad breath and her teeth look so clean.  A friend of ours who runs a veterinary and rescue clinic recommended them to us when our dog was very little, and we've sworn by them ever since."

I purchased a couple of boxes and tried it out on my husband.  He loved it!  On top of being healthy, it has wonderful flavor which is very important to me.  After trying this I purchased a dozen boxes.  I will continue to buy this product because it is fabulous.  Thanks DeBoles!"

The last batch of IG oolong I ordered did not satisfy as much as this has, and if memory serves it might have been more expensive.  When you order this tea you get a seal-able pouch that contains more than enough oolong to get you through a few months if you are a daily drinker like me.  The tea has a toasty flavor and is not particularly astringent.  The tea is very pleasant and you get a great deal of it for your money."
